//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ["Alien", "Aliens", "alien 3"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let movieChoice = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let moviesArrLength = movies.length;
console.log(moviesArrLength)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastMovieChoice = movies[movies.length-1]
console.log(lastMovieChoice)
