# 100Dev


Joined up with #100 Devs in late May of 2022. The goal was to strengthen my knowledge in web development that I learned while In college, as well as gain a deeper understanding and continue this path forward.

I follow this path which contains videos/files from cohort2:

and complete and upload all my assignments which would be found by going into Classxx -> Classxx -> homework file.
ex: Class02 -> class02-homework - > index.html
